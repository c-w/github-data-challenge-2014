# Humans of GitHub (HoG)

## Introduction

This entry to the [Third Annual GitHub Data
Challenge](https://github.com/blog/1864-third-annual-github-data-challenge)
offers a visual exploration of the question *who uses GitHub*. In the past,
GitHub's user-base has been analyzed by exploring various social graphs inferred
using the site's [API](https://developer.github.com/v3/). The novelty of our
approach is that it *puts a face to the name*. Our visualization uses the GitHub
[Users API](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/) to infer Eigenfaces for the
"humans of GitHub" and explores whether there are any strong patterns in the
avatars of GitHub users.
